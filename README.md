This project is about extracting skills from resume and making it easier for recruiters to shortlist resumes.


As the basic entity here is resume, let’s start from that.
Each and every resume had a set of skills. 
One thing I noticed by looking at the raw data was, every resume had some technical and some non-technical skills.
Judging a student from his technical skills for a non-technical job won’t be fair.
Hence, I decided to classify the skills into tech and non-tech.
To my surprise, most trending non-technical skill is English. Hence, we can say that many candidates are available for call-center related or communication related jobs.
Hot technical skill is C language.
It is really surprising that, buzzwords like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science were rarely found.
This could be a better chance to let people know the technologies they should be learning or they can learn in order to bag a better job because that is the sole reason of making a creative resume.
Talking about my experience with data, some students have uploaded their resume as a scanned image which is hard to parse, hence in hiring-by-machine, they would lose a chance.
For a resume to be easily parsed, students should keep it as simple as possible without any images, graphics etc.

Take a look at the report to see the visual representations.
